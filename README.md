# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It contains a profile component styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX
- How to style with inline CSS
- How to create and render functional components

## Challenges
It took me longer than I care to admit to recognize why `UserProfile.jsx` needs to go first to `App.jsx` before then going to `main.jsx`.  I did not avail myself of any of the .css files because the idea, as I understood the assignment, was to use inline throughout.  This underscored how messy such styling can get and why it is best avoided with large projects that have interoperating elements.
